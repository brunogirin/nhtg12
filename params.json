{"name":"nhtg12","body":"# nhtg12\r\n\r\n**Prototype for Rewired State National Hack The Government Day, 2012**\r\n\r\nThis is a small web calculator written by Bruno Girin for Rewired State National Hack The Government Day, 2012. It uses a small data set on home insulation options for 3-bedroom semi-detached houses, provided as an Excel file in the day's [dataset](https://github.com/rewiredstate/nhtg12):\r\n\r\n`datasets/decc/est/est-3-bed-semi-data.xlsx`\r\n\r\nThis file was converted to CSV prior to being used so that it can easily be read using the python language.\r\n\r\nThe resulting application is a small stand-alone web application. It uses a web server script found\r\n[on ActiveState](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/392879-my-first-application-server/)\r\n\r\nThe only modification to the script is to start the web server on port 8080 rather than port 80 so that it can be run as a non-privileged user.\r\n\r\nHow to start the web server:\r\n\r\n`$ python ScriptServer.py`\r\n\r\nYou can then navigate to the web page at this address: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)\r\n\r\nThe application asks a number of questions about your house and finds suitable energy efficiency improvements. It displays a number of data items for each method, in particular the costs, savings and number of years needed for the investment to pay for itself.\r\n\r\nThings that can be improved:\r\n* The presentation is very basic and would benefit from artwork and styling,\r\n* The code is not very pythonic and could be significantly improved,\r\n* The list of items returned should be ordered based on savings (either monetary or carbon savings) and grouped into categories.\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Prototype for Rewired State National Hack The Government Day, 2012","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
